A CVPR project which is created to use HOG feature extraction and Multilayer stacking CNN to detect 7 different distraction behaviors, and combined MobileNet and Ensemble Model (XGBoost, LightGBM and RandomForest) to determine whether a driver is yawning or with closed eyes for detection of drowsy driving in consecutive video frames.
